  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be addressed in the diff. REQ-1 is fixed via explicit CSS rules in index.css forcing visible text/placeholder colors on input and textarea elements, plus explicit Tailwind classes on the BuilderPage textarea. REQ-2 is fixed via a reworked BuilderPage handleGenerate function that calls generateFromPrompt, saves to backend via useGenerateAppCreation, navigates to the viewer, shows loading state, and surfaces errors. The backend main.mo now has the generateAppCreation endpoint. No significant missing requirements were detected.",
